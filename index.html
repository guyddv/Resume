            <!-- I wanted to try collapsing the <ul>s for these employers, but the CSS code was very complicated.  May come back to it later. 
                 I did not use <span> or <div> tags and decided just to use <section> tags to keep everything a bit cleaner. 
                 Only used 3 employers here to keep the resume succint. -->
